Hello! We are product-based capstone team which formed to fulfill graduation requirement in Bangkit Academy 2023 Batch 1. Bangkit is a program designed to prepare students with in-demand skills and tech certifications. At capstone project, we're in a mission to tackle real world problems with technology, we will learn how to manage a real-world project.

### *The Facts*
Based on a survey conducted by the Rakuten Insight Center in Indonesia in 2022, it was found that 67% out of 10.422 respondents owned pets. 23% were recorded as not having any pets, and the remaining 10% admitted to having owned pets before. The high percentage of pet ownership is accompanied by a high number of deaths due to diseases. In the past 5 years (2015-2019), there were a total of 404,306 cases of rabies transmission in Indonesia, and 544 of them resulted in death, and North Sulawesi being the province with the highest number of fatalities (https://sehatnegeriku.kemkes.go.id/). As for cat cases, a study revealed that approximately 65% of cats taken to veterinarians already showed severe conditions, which were caused by economic factors and the busyness of their owners. Approximately 60.9% of cat deaths in Surabaya were due to the uneven distribution of veterinarians, and causing difficulties in treating cat diseases (Chazar et al., 2019).

### *Problem statement*
Is there a way we can do to assist pet owners in taking care of their pets, addressing the limited availability of veterinarians in certain areas, and the high cost of treatment at animal clinics?

### *Solution*
We aim to offer a solution to overcome above problem, introducing **OPet** which stands for **Online Diagnosis for Your Pet's Diseases**. OPet utilize Supervised Machine Learning and the native Kotlin programming language to develop an application to detect early signs of diseases in pets based on their symptoms. In our app, we will only focus on the dominant pets in Indonesia including cat, fish, bird, and dog. This is not a random choice, it was based on the survey conducted by the Rakuten Insight Center in Indonesia in 2022. 


## <p align="center"> Our Great Team </p>
Our team consist of 6 students from 3 learning paths. Machine Learning divison is responsible for building Classification Algorithms to predict pet diseases based on pet symptomps. Cloud Computing divison will be responsible for building endpoint APIs, app infrastructure and implementing a storage model with Google Cloud Platform. Mobile Development divison is mainly responsible for designing application interface, translating the design to Android Studio using Kotlin as well.
